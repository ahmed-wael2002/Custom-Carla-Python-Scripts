# Perception Client

This project is a perception client implementation based on the work from [Meta-Learning-Enhanced-YOLOv8-for-Precision-Traffic-Light-Color-Detection-in-ADAS](https://github.com/VasuTammisetti/Meta-Learning-Enhanced-YOLOv8-for-Precision-Traffic-Light-Color-Detection-in-ADAS).

## Overview

This perception client is designed to work with CARLA simulator for traffic light detection and classification. It leverages the meta-learning enhanced YOLOv8 model for precise traffic light color detection, which is particularly useful for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).

## Features

- Traffic light detection and classification
- Integration with CARLA simulator
- Real-time perception processing
- Meta-learning enhanced YOLOv8 implementation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CARLA Simulator
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Other dependencies (to be listed in requirements.txt)


## Usage

Instructions for running the perception client will be added here.
